# <Week1 Challenge Assignement Solution  >

## Description

This project is the solution for the Bootcamp week 1 Challenge .The objective was to refactor the existing code without changing the functionality and visual design for the website.
-I have tried my best to modify the code using the HTML/CSS skills and knowledge that I gained in the first week.
-the refactored code has been implemented to use html semantic elements and more logical structure and styling redundancies have been removed.
-I am happy that I was able to actually apply the skills, it gave me more clarity and confidence about the knowledge.



## Installation

-A public link has been created for the website which requires any web browser.


## Usage

The code renders to a webpage for Horiseon company which provides various marketing services.
-The text links in the navigation bar in the header  are links to the referenced content section on the bottom section of the page.
-The middle section is the main content of the page describing the services.
-the section in the right lists the benefits of different services provided.

-Note: Only the html code and the css style file has been refactored to make the code cleaner and semantically efficient.Functionality remains the same as existed.

Code changes done:
HTML file has been changed:
-for the Title of the website making it more specific.
-for the non-semantic like div  elements replacing them with semantic elements like nav,sections,header 
-for the redundant code which calls different classes imlamenting the same properties.

CSS file has been changed:
-Classes implementing same properties replaced by one class.
-selector calling methods changed according to the changes made in html.
-Codelines reduced from 200 to 133 making it more efficient and readable.
